# The Penn-Northwest Homegrown Initiative's: Homegrown Mercer County Website

The Penn-Northwest Homegrown Initiative is a local nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of people in Western Pennsylvanian community of Mercer County. This project is their website - the main functionality of which is helping people find work, homes, schools, activities, and community in the area.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap v5.2, Netlify Hosting

This site constitutes my first foray into the world of freelance web development - that is, the first project I've built for someone other than friends and family! The tech used is entirely vanilla HTML, CSS and JS (not counting the Bootstrap framework).

Primarily this is a static site, composed of 6 main HTML pages, each of which serving the purpose of elucidating some part of the local community to the user. The landing index.html was the greatest challenge of the entire site. As the user scrolls down on desktop they'll find distinct sections that work as calls to action to each of the other pages on the site. Each of these sections contain a series of overlayed Divs - each of which with varying skew, transform, and styling rules that in sum total create a cool modern diagonal effect.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
